This type of ransomware will only encript files if you want one that encrypt folders also just say something in issues and i will upload so you can encrypt folders also

for decryption you have to run decrypt.py and the password is iwant1

if you want also to run this files in pcs without python use auto-py-to-exe so you can make your ransomware better, but you will have to change yourname.py to yourname.exe in the python file
